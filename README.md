# Big-Data-DS730-Project-3-HIVE

This project involved loading and querying 3 large datasets on HDFS. We had to create 8 HIVE scripts to answer 8 questions. 

My scripts were developed on Azure and then finally run on AWS.

Some specific actions include joining, filtering, sorting and selecting the datasets.
